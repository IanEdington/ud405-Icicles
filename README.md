## 1. Add Stub Classes
We just used the LibGDX project setup utility to create a fresh project. Now let's start to create the classes we'll need for Icicles.

We need the following classes:

- [x] IciclesGame: Subclass of Game
- [x] IciclesScreen: Implements Screen
- [x] DifficultyScreen: Implements Screen
- [x] Player, Icicles, Icicle, and Constants: just plain old Java classes
